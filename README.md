2D Star Wars Xwing Shooter Game

I am recreating Lucas Arts X-Wing into a 2D shooter. Where possible I am trying to keep as much as I can true to the original eg.
Weapons, damage etc.

This is a work in progress, sadly I havn't had much time to work on it recently.

Currently only 2 player mode works and only 1 demo level is available to play.

I have included a JPG displaying the game controls, eventually I plan the user to be able to change/remap the controls as they wish.  Player one can use either a joypad or the keyboard. To control player 2, 2 joypads must be connected.

In order to make this game good, I require heaps of artwork (more ships, bosses, backgrounds, ground units) and thats been a struggle to obtain so far..
